This is a revision of Scrimba's Bob Ziroll's comprehensive React course. My React felt a bit rusty so as a cure for that I decided to redo the best react course I ever came across.

It's pretty hands-on and project based.

It covered props, state, components, styling, useEffect and ofcourse components.

The projects include : 

* A react facts app
* A digital business card
* An AirBnB Experiences clone
* A meme generator
